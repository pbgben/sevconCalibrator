DIY Calibrator for powerPak

The calibrator is a "dumb" controller, it just displays data and sends button presses... This mash of code does allow you to read and adjust settings, but the display is buggy and often requires you to cycle back and forward to show the correct thing. 

Parts:
Arduino Nano
MCP2515 CAN Bus Module
16x2 display
Matrix keypad
Voltage stepdown
